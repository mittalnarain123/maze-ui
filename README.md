# MazeUi

This project provides UI interface to the Maze project. It is implemented using below frameworks:
- Angular (6+)
- Angular Material (for components, theming etc.)
- Angular fxFlex (Flexbox support for angular)

The project is currently live at https://maze.narainmittal.now.sh/ Thanks to [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)

## Getting started

This application relies on maze api for generating a random maze and the solution and that needs to be up and running for proper functioning of this project. Take a look at [maze-node-app](https://github.com/narainmittal/maze-node-app)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
